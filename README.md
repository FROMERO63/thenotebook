# Note Taker

## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a promt that will generate a simple logo based off user choices
Node was used to build a command line prompt with inquirer that would then input the user choices into created formulas and then into an svg file that displays the created logo.
This was built with no starter code. The building of this was assisted by the previous inquirer assignment
This solved the problem of a needing a logo but not knowing what or how to create it.
I learned a lot more about object managemnet, importing/requiring from other files, and also how to use SVG files as we did not learn about them in class.
Overall this project helped to get more practice using node, jest and svg files


## Installation

This project was created from scratch. I used Jest to test the code. I used node and javascript to create the code. I used inquirer to create and run the prompt for user input. I used an svg file to create the logo. Also downloaded the SVG Previewer extension for Vscode to view the generated logo

## Usage

Run the jest test to see if the functions work

Run index.js to start the prompt
